# Description of Project 
For my Information Visualization course, I created a data visualization based on a topic of my choice. Using film gross data from Box Office Mojo . 

# Result  
From working on this project, I was able to successfully capture a cinematic and regal tone through my visual representation of the data, creating a compelling visualization for the audience. I accurately and clearly depicted film profit trends and patterns
